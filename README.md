## You Should Know
- HTML
- CSS Layout
- Responsive Web Design

## Your Mission
Without fail, a front-end developer will need to convert a wireframe into a fully functioning website. For this assignment, you'll be using the below mockup image and turning it into an active web page:

### Explore Mode

**Challenge #1.1:** Let's work on your layout skills! Recreate the web page from the mockup above. Place your HTML in a file called `index.html`, and your CSS in a file called `styles.css`. All of the images you use should be placed in an `images` directory. 
**Goal #1.1:** Create the website as shown in the mockup image. 

**Challenge #1.2:** It's always good practice to add your projects to source control. Create a git repository for your code and add it to Github. 

### Adventure Mode

**Challenge #2.1:** Modify your existing page so that the design is responsive across a wide range of screens. How the page scales is up to you, but make sure that everything still works as intended even at small widths. Don't forget to update your Github with the responsive design!
